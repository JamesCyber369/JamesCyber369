## 👤 About Me

I am transitioning from a career in **electrical work** into **IT and Cybersecurity**, with a focus on **Cloud Security** and **AI Security**. Rather than just studying theory, I chose to get hands-on — acquiring real enterprise server hardware and building a functional home lab completely from scratch.

This repository documents every step of that journey — from receiving unknown hardware with no documentation, physically inspecting and identifying every component, sourcing missing parts, setting up networking, installing a hypervisor, and ultimately building a full enterprise-grade security lab.

> Coming from electrical work gave me a strong foundation in physical infrastructure, systems thinking, and troubleshooting — skills that translate directly into IT.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a fully functional enterprise home lab using virtualization
- Learn hardware identification, inspection, and documentation
- Configure server networking and remote management via IPMI
- Deploy and manage operating systems on bare metal
- Build cloud infrastructure skills using Proxmox
- Practice cybersecurity with SIEM, IDS/IPS, and vulnerability scanning
- Develop AI/LLM security skills on real deployed models
- Document everything as a professional portfolio — including real troubleshooting, not just a finished result

## 🖥️ Lab Hardware

### Current Active Setup

This lab currently runs on **a single physical server**, with all phases implemented as virtual machines within a single Proxmox host.

| Device | Model | Role | RAM | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Active Server** | Supermicro X10SLH-N6-ST031 | Primary Lab Server — Proxmox Host | 16GB DDR3 | ✅ Active — Proxmox Installed |
| Reserved Server 1 | Supermicro SSG-6028R | Reserved for future expansion | 32GB DDR3 | ⏸️ Offline |
| Reserved Server 2 | Supermicro SYS-6018R-WTRT | Reserved for future expansion | 64GB DDR4 | ⏸️ Offline |

### Active Server Specs

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **CPU** | Intel Xeon E3-1231 v3 @ 3.40GHz, 4 cores |
| **RAM** | 16GB DDR3 ECC (expandable to ~32GB) |
| **OS** | Proxmox VE 9.2.2 |
| **Management IP** | 10.0.0.50 (Proxmox) / 10.0.0.243 (IPMI) |
